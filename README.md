# Quikr-Car-Price-Prediction
This project focuses on predicting car prices using the Quikr Car dataset. By leveraging regression techniques, the aim is to develop a model that accurately predicts the price of a used car based on the features of the dataset
# Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of car listings from Quikr Car. It includes the following features:                           
Name: The name of the car                                                                                                              
Company: The manufacturer or company of the car                                                                                        
Year: The year of manufacture of the car                                                                                               
Price: The price of the car                                                                                                            
Kms Driven: The number of kilometers driven by the car                                                                                 
Fuel Type: The type of fuel used by the car                                                                                            
Initially, the dataset required cleaning to remove any inconsistencies or missing values.
# Steps Involved 
# 1.Importing the libraries
The necessary libraries and dependencies are imported to perform the analysis and modeling.
# 2.Importing the dataset
The dataset is imported into the project for further processing.
# 3.Data Cleaning
The dataset undergoes a data-cleaning process to handle any inconsistencies or missing values.
# 4.Exploratory Data Analysis
An exploratory analysis of the dataset is performed to gain insights and understand the relationships between the variables.
# 5.Data Preprocessing
Categorical variables are encoded using suitable techniques to prepare the data for model training.
# 6.Train-Test Split
The dataset is divided into training and test sets to evaluate the performance of the models.
# 7.Model Training and Evaluation
Regression models are trained on the training set and evaluated on the test set using the R2 score as the evaluation metric.
# 8.Hyperparameter Tuning
The hyperparameters of the chosen regression model are tuned using techniques such as GridSearchCV to optimize the model's performance.
